    <p> Beware of the Creepy Crabber! This creature is a big, red crab that finds great joy in "crabbing" anything in sight. It has a cherry red body with two wide eyes that seek out its prey. Unlike a normal crab, this creature has the sharpest fangs one has ever seen. While most monsters come out at night, you can find the Creepy Crabber hanging out on a beach on the brightest of days! Keep yourself clear of the water, as the Creepy Crabbers will most likely be around!
